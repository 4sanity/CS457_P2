SO Derrek,
I am real sorry about setting up the connections but i dont understand the way you did it.
Most of the code I just copied the way i connected in my chat application.

I grow more delirious as time progresses, i keep running my tests without doing "make" and wondering why there is no change.
Good news I have finally finished sending the URL accross the network, now if i can send a file i will be in good shape.

K its a little bit of a mess but its doing a lot of shit. It passes URL, creates chainlist.txt on SS and enumerates in both classes.
What i would like you to look at is how we are going to thread SS and call awget with each, text me if you gots questions.
